# Objectives of the Weather Dashboard:

## Real-Time Monitoring of Key Weather Metrics:

The top "Last value of RainToday_code" and live metrics like "Current" (0.252) suggest real-time tracking.

This feature allows users (meteorologists, analysts, or industries like agriculture) to quickly assess rainfall occurrences and other weather conditions without delay.

## Wind Behavior Analysis:

"Average WindGust Speed" provides a numerical summary (23.717) to monitor wind intensity, critical for industries like aviation, shipping, or infrastructure planning.

The "9 AM vs 3 PM Wind Speed" chart compares wind variations at two specific times of the day. This could help identify patterns of wind acceleration during peak hours,
useful for energy sectors like wind farming or urban planners.

## Temperature Trends (Maximum Temperature Insight):

"Median of MaxTemp" highlights the central tendency of temperature. The value 22.683 indicates current trends, helping to monitor deviations and ensure seasonal forecasting
accuracy.

For sectors like energy or agriculture, such temperature insights help optimize resources (e.g., energy demand in peak summer).

## Rainfall Analysis:

"Rainfall vs Evaporation": This chart visually correlates evaporation levels with rainfall to understand water balance. High evaporation with low rainfall could signal 
potential drought risks.

Such data is crucial for water resource management, farming, and disaster preparedness.

## Humidity and Rainfall Correlation:

The "Rainfall & Humidity Relationship" graph analyzes how rainfall depends on humidity levels (measured at 9 AM).

A positive trend here can help improve rainfall prediction models and inform decisions in irrigation, infrastructure planning, or weather-dependent activities.

## Sunshine Duration Impact on Rainfall:

The "Rainfall & Sunshine" chart shows the interplay between sunshine hours and rainfall patterns.

A spike in sunshine hours with low rainfall might indicate prolonged dry spells, aiding sectors like solar energy and climate risk analysis.

## Time-Based Weather Anomalies:

The inclusion of a time axis (e.g., timestamp per minute for wind speed) reflects the time-series nature of weather data. This helps identify anomalies or trends, such as
sudden wind spikes or temperature drops.


# Managerial implications and insights 

## 1. Locations with Rainfall


![Locations with rainfall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7ccb46-1bf9-4184-87ac-a470f9be28e4)

### Observations:

Certain regions experience higher rainfall compared to others.

The intensity or frequency of rainfall may vary geographically.

### Managerial Implications and Insights:

Resource Allocation: In regions with heavy rainfall, businesses should plan for disruptions by allocating additional resources for infrastructure maintenance, waterproofing, and logistics adjustments.

Agriculture Planning: For agricultural businesses, identifying regions with consistent rainfall patterns can optimize crop planning and irrigation strategies.

Retail and Supply Chain: Rain-prone areas might experience reduced footfall at stores. Managers should leverage online delivery options, stock rain-related products (e.g., umbrellas, raincoats), and run targeted marketing campaigns to maintain sales.

Construction Projects: Delays due to heavy rainfall in specific locations need to be anticipated and mitigated using project buffers or seasonal work planning.

## 2. 9AM and 3PM Wind Speed


![9am 3pm wind speed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09e634ee-b922-4400-9280-3a9caeed1c4f)


### Observations:

Wind speed might show a variation between morning (9 AM) and afternoon (3 PM), indicating either an increasing or decreasing trend.

Higher wind speeds could be concentrated at certain times of the day.

### Managerial Implications and Insights:

Renewable Energy: Wind energy projects should align with time-specific wind patterns. Higher wind speeds at 3 PM, for example, could improve energy output if turbines are optimized for this period.

Safety Measures: In industries like construction or outdoor operations, managers need to schedule critical tasks during calmer wind conditions to ensure safety and minimize accidents.

Logistics and Transportation: For aviation or shipping companies, understanding wind patterns at specific times can help optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption, and avoid delays.

Marketing Insights: Businesses, such as outdoor events or cafes, can avoid scheduling activities during peak wind times to ensure customer comfort and safety.

## 3. Rainfall and Humidity Relation


![rainfall and humidity relation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/249afef3-677e-4dcc-a2d9-a9db235514ee)

   
### Observations:

A clear relationship between rainfall and humidity levels is likely present. Higher humidity may coincide with increased rainfall.

This relationship could highlight trends where rainfall intensity correlates with specific humidity thresholds.

### Managerial Implications and Insights:

Weather-Driven Demand Forecasting: Retailers can anticipate spikes in demand for products like dehumidifiers, rain gear, and indoor activities when humidity and rainfall levels rise.

Agricultural Adjustments: High humidity combined with rainfall could increase the risk of fungal diseases for crops. Managers should preemptively implement pest and disease control measures.

Manufacturing and Warehousing: Industries sensitive to humidity (e.g., textile, food processing, and electronics) must install humidity control systems to protect goods from moisture damage.

Tourism and Hospitality: Managers should prepare for low tourist turnout during periods of high rainfall and humidity by offering indoor experiences and discounts to attract visitors.


## 4. Average WindGustDir_code


![avg windgust speed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e99e1c42-96d9-4f80-9d48-488c14f71ceb)


### Observations:

This graph shows the average wind gust direction code, which provides a measure of the directionality of the wind gusts. 

The value shown is 23.717, which indicates the predominant wind gust direction. This information could be useful for activities and operations that are sensitive to wind direction, such as aviation, outdoor events, or renewable energy production.


### Managerial implications:

Understanding the prevailing wind gust direction can help optimize the placement and orientation of wind turbines or other wind-sensitive equipment.

Knowing the typical wind patterns can assist in planning outdoor events, transportation routes, or other activities that may be affected by wind direction.

The wind gust direction data can be incorporated into weather forecasting and risk management models to improve decision-making.

## 5. Rainfall & Sunshine
