# Objectives of the Weather Dashboard:

## Real-Time Monitoring of Key Weather Metrics:

The top "Last value of RainToday_code" and live metrics like "Current" (0.252) suggest real-time tracking.

This feature allows users (meteorologists, analysts, or industries like agriculture) to quickly assess rainfall occurrences and other weather conditions without delay.

## Wind Behavior Analysis:

"Average WindGust Speed" provides a numerical summary (23.717) to monitor wind intensity, critical for industries like aviation, shipping, or infrastructure planning.

The "9 AM vs 3 PM Wind Speed" chart compares wind variations at two specific times of the day. This could help identify patterns of wind acceleration during peak hours,

useful for energy sectors like wind farming or urban planners.

## Temperature Trends (Maximum Temperature Insight):

"Median of MaxTemp" highlights the central tendency of temperature. The value 22.683 indicates current trends, helping to monitor deviations and ensure seasonal forecasting

accuracy.

For sectors like energy or agriculture, such temperature insights help optimize resources (e.g., energy demand in peak summer).

## Rainfall Analysis:

"Rainfall vs Evaporation": This chart visually correlates evaporation levels with rainfall to understand water balance. High evaporation with low rainfall could signal 

potential drought risks.

Such data is crucial for water resource management, farming, and disaster preparedness.

## Humidity and Rainfall Correlation:

The "Rainfall & Humidity Relationship" graph analyzes how rainfall depends on humidity levels (measured at 9 AM).

A positive trend here can help improve rainfall prediction models and inform decisions in irrigation, infrastructure planning, or weather-dependent activities.

## Sunshine Duration Impact on Rainfall:

The "Rainfall & Sunshine" chart shows the interplay between sunshine hours and rainfall patterns.

A spike in sunshine hours with low rainfall might indicate prolonged dry spells, aiding sectors like solar energy and climate risk analysis.

## Time-Based Weather Anomalies:

The inclusion of a time axis (e.g., timestamp per minute for wind speed) reflects the time-series nature of weather data. This helps identify anomalies or trends, such as

sudden wind spikes or temperature drops.
